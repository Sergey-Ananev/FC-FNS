Annotation:	The program is intended for consistent modeling of fuel nuclide flows in the main and near-wall plasma, injection and pumping systems for a thermonuclear neutron source (TNS). It differs from the program " FC - FNS 3.0" in that this version contains a modification using data from joint modeling by the SOLPS 4.3 and ASTRA codes ( taking into account ions instead of electrons in the particle transport equations) using partial confinement times of working gas ions from different sources in the tokamak plasma for calculating. Calculations of fuel nuclide flows and content are performed for all TNS thermonuclear fuel cycle systems in the window of variable parameters - plasma density and particle confinement characteristics : particle diffusion coefficient k and electron thermal conductivity coefficient k .
